# VHDL SAD Architecture for FPGA

This repository contains the design and implementation of a digital architecture for computing the Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) between pairs of grayscale images.

The architecture is described in VHDL and targets FPGA devices. Functional correctness has been verified through an extensive set of testbenches. The design was synthesized and implemented on a ZyBo Development Board.

Results confirm correct functionality, low resource and power usage, and a maximum operating frequency suitable for real-time image processing.

Academic project developed by Alessio Fontana for the Microelectronic Systems Design final test at the University of Pisa.
